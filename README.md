# Blue-Shell

This is a shell I created for systems programming. It is written in C and uses system calls such as fork(), exec(), and wait().

# How to Run

  1. Ensure you are on a machine that can run C code (ex. Linux, Windows with WSL)
  2. Clone this repository
  3. CD into this repositories local folder
  4. Run this command: "cmake -S . -B build"
  5. Run this command: "cmake --build build"
  6. Run this command: "cd build"
  7. Run this command: "./shell"

  Now the shell will be running and will operate like a normal shell for the most part. You can type "help" in the shell to see what it can do, enjoy!
